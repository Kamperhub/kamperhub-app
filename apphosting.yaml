# Settings to manage and configure a Firebase App Hosting backend.
# For a full list of options, see the Firebase App Hosting documentation:
# https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-hosting/configure-backend

# Specifies the region where your backend will be deployed.
# It's best to choose a region close to your primary user base.
# A list of available regions can be found here: https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-hosting/locations
region: us-central1

# Defines the runtime resources and scaling behavior for your backend.
runConfig:
  # The number of CPU cores to allocate to each backend instance.
  # A good starting point is 1. You can increase this for more computationally intensive tasks.
  # Valid values: 1, 2, 4
  cpu: 1

  # The amount of memory to allocate to each instance.
  # 512MiB is a cost-effective starting point for a standard Next.js app.
  # Valid values: 512Mi, 1Gi, 2Gi, 4Gi, 8Gi, 16Gi, 32Gi
  memoryMiB: 512

  # The number of concurrent requests a single instance can handle before scaling up.
  # The default of 80 is a good balance for most web applications.
  concurrency: 80

  # The maximum number of instances your backend can scale up to.
  # This is a key control for managing costs. Start low and increase as needed.
  maxInstances: 2
