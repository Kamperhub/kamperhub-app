// Simple FAQ knowledge base
const faqData = [
  { 
    keywords: ["tyre pressure", "tire pressure", "tyres", "tires"], 
    answer: "Caravan tyre pressures are crucial for safety and tyre life. They typically range from 40-65 PSI, but always check the caravan's tyre placard or the tyre manufacturer's specific recommendations for your model and load. Tow vehicle tyre pressures should also be adjusted as per its placard, especially when towing." 
  },
  { 
    keywords: ["awning setup", "set up awning", "deploy awning"], 
    answer: "To set up your caravan awning: 1. Unlock any travel locks. 2. Use the awning rod to hook the pull strap and roll the awning out. 3. Extend the support legs and position them vertically or against the caravan wall. 4. Secure the legs. 5. Tension the fabric using the rafters or tensioning knobs. Ensure it's well-secured, especially if wind is expected." 
  },
  { 
    keywords: ["battery flat", "battery dead", "charge battery"], 
    answer: "If your caravan battery is flat: 1. Check if it's an issue with the charger or a blown fuse. 2. Try charging it using your tow vehicle (if set up for it), a 240V smart charger when connected to mains power, or a solar panel. 3. If it's an old battery, it might need replacement. Deep cycle batteries can be damaged if left flat for too long." 
  },
  {
    keywords: ["toilet cassette", "empty toilet"],
    answer: "To empty your caravan toilet cassette: 1. Ensure the blade valve is closed. 2. Remove the cassette from its external hatch. 3. Transport it to an approved dump point. 4. Unscrew the spout, point it downwards into the dump point, and press the air vent button to empty smoothly. 5. Rinse the cassette with water. 6. Add the appropriate toilet chemical before reinserting."
  },
  {
    keywords: ["sway control", "caravan swaying"],
    answer: "Caravan sway can be dangerous. To prevent it: 1. Ensure correct weight distribution (approx 10-15% of caravan ATM on the towball). 2. Don't overload the rear of the caravan. 3. Check tyre pressures. 4. Drive at appropriate speeds for conditions. 5. Consider using a weight distribution hitch and/or an electronic sway control system. If sway occurs, gently ease off the accelerator and apply the caravan's electric brakes manually (if fitted with a controller that allows this) â€“ do not slam on the vehicle brakes or turn the steering wheel sharply."

  prompt: `You are a friendly and helpful caravan support chatbot for KamperHub. Your primary goal is to provide accurate and useful answers to user questions about caravanning.

When a user asks a question:
1. First, use the 'getFaqAnswer' tool to check if there's a pre-defined answer for the topic in our knowledge base. Provide the keywords from the user's question to the tool.
2. If the 'getFaqAnswer' tool returns an answer, use this information as the core of your response. You can rephrase it slightly to be more conversational if needed, but the factual content should come from the tool's output.
3. If the 'getFaqAnswer' tool does not return an answer (meaning it's not in our FAQ), then answer the question to the best of your general knowledge about caravanning.
4. Regardless of whether an FAQ answer was found or not, if you believe a YouTube video would further help the user, use the 'findYoutubeLink' tool with a relevant search query to find a video link and include it in your response.

User's Question: {{{question}}}
