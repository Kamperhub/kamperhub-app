# KamperHub Development Roadmap

This document tracks the development priorities, future features, and completed milestones for the KamperHub application.

---

## **Current Priorities**

### 1. Stability & Bug Fixing
*   **Objective:** Resolve persistent data loading and authentication issues to ensure a stable and reliable user experience on the new server-based infrastructure.
*   **Key Areas:**
    *   Investigate and fix errors preventing vehicle, caravan, and WDH data from loading on the `/vehicles` page.
    *   Address any remaining `Unauthorized: Invalid ID token` or `client is offline` errors.
    *   Ensure all user preferences and settings load correctly for all user types (including admin).
    *   **Fuel Log Toast Action:** Ensure the "Add Category" button in the "Missing 'Fuel' Category" error message correctly navigates the user to the trip planner.

### 2. New Feature Development
*   **Objective:** Begin implementing new, high-value features now that the core data migration is complete.
*   **Next Up:**
    *   **Fuel Log & Maintenance Tracker:** Build the user interface for logging fuel and tracking vehicle/caravan maintenance tasks. The backend APIs for this are already in place.
    *   ✅ **AI-Powered Packing Assistant:** The Genkit flow to help users generate packing lists based on trip details is now complete and integrated.

---

## **Completed Milestones**

### ✅ **Project: Migrate from LocalStorage to Firestore**

*   **Status:** Complete
*   **Objective:** Move all application data from the browser's `localStorage` to Firebase Firestore to provide a persistent, synchronized, and backed-up user experience.

#### **Phase 1: Backend Setup & API Development (Complete)**
*   Defined Firestore data structures for all user-specific models under `/users/{userId}`.
*   Created secure API endpoints for all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for Vehicles, Caravans, WDHs, Inventory, Trips, Bookings, and User Preferences.

#### **Phase 2: Frontend Refactoring (Complete)**
*   Refactored all relevant pages and components (`/vehicles`, `/inventory`, `/trip-expense-planner`, `/triplog`, `/checklists`, `/bookings`, `/`) to use `react-query` for server state management.
*   All UI components now fetch and mutate data via the new API endpoints instead of directly accessing `localStorage`.

#### **Phase 3: One-Time Data Migration (Complete & Obsolete)**
*   A one-time migration path was established to move existing user data from localStorage.
*   The `/api/migrate-local-storage` endpoint, used for this one-time migration, is now obsolete and has been removed.

## Future Development Ideas

This section tracks potential new features and enhancements for future consideration.

### Core Functionality Enhancements

*   **Performance Optimization: Server-Side Data Fetching:**
    *   **The Problem:** Currently, data-heavy pages (like "Vehicles", "Inventory") show loading skeletons while the client-side fetches data, leading to perceived slowness.
    *   **The Solution:** Implement server-side data fetching using Next.js Server Components.
        1.  **Pre-fetch Data on the Server:** When a page is requested, the server will gather all necessary data (vehicles, caravans, WDHs, etc.) in a single, efficient operation.
        2.  **Eliminate Initial Loading Skeletons:** The page will be sent to the browser with the data already included, making content appear instantly.
        3.  **Retain Dynamic Updates:** The application will still use TanStack Query for dynamic updates and mutations after the initial fast load.
    *   **Example Implementation (for `/vehicles` page):**
        *   Convert `src/app/vehicles/page.tsx` to a Server Component.
        *   Fetch all vehicle, caravan, and WDH data directly on the server within this component.
        *   Pass the pre-fetched data as props to the `VehicleManager`, `CaravanManager`, and `WDHManager` components.
        *   Update those client components to use the pre-fetched data for their initial display, removing their individual loading states.

*   **Multi-Stop Trip Planning:**
    *   Allow users to add multiple intermediate waypoints to their trips in the Trip Planner.
    *   Display the full multi-stop route on the map.
    *   Calculate total distance, duration, and fuel estimates for the entire multi-leg journey.
    *   Update the Trip Log to clearly represent and recall multi-stop trips.

*   **Advanced Weight Distribution Calculator:**
    *   Enhance the Inventory & Weight Management section with a more precise calculator for Tow Ball Mass (TBM).
    *   Allow users to specify the exact longitudinal position of items within defined storage locations (or even general areas like "front," "middle," "rear" of the caravan).
    *   Use these positions and weights to provide a more accurate TBM estimation than the current simple percentage of payload.

### User Experience & Engagement

*   **Enhanced Rewards & Gamification:**
    *   Implement the "Rewards Program" outlined in `/rewards`.
    *   Introduce badges or achievements for milestones (e.g., total distance traveled, number of trips completed, types of sites visited).
    *   Potentially add a points system that could unlock minor perks or cosmetic customizations.

*   **Community Features (Phase 1 - Sharing):**
    *   Allow users to (optionally) share saved trips (anonymized or with attribution) with other KamperHub users.
    *   Enable sharing of public campsite reviews or tips.

*   **Offline Checklists:**
    *   Investigate options for making checklists (especially for an active trip) available and modifiable offline, with syncing when connectivity is restored.

### AI & Automation

*   **AI-Powered Trip Suggestions:**
    *   Based on user preferences (e.g., type of travel, interests, past trips), suggest potential destinations or routes.
    *   Integrate with the Chatbot to help users plan trips conversationally.

*   **Automated Maintenance Reminders:**
    *   Allow users to log caravan/vehicle service dates and set reminders for common maintenance tasks (e.g., tyre checks, bearing services) based on time or distance traveled (if GPS tracking were ever implemented).

### Newly Suggested Feature Ideas

*   **Internal Campsite/POI Review & Rating System:**
    *   Allow users to write personal reviews, give star ratings, and upload photos for campsites or POIs.
    *   Initially stored locally, with potential for cloud sync and community sharing later.
    *   Could integrate with Trip Log and Bookings.

*   **Travel Journaling & Photo Gallery per Trip:**
    *   Within the Trip Log, allow users to add daily journal entries and upload/link a few photos for each trip to capture memories.

*   **New Article: Towing Mirrors Guide:**
    *   Create an article explaining the legal requirements and practical benefits of using towing mirrors.
    *   Cover different types of mirrors (e.g., clamp-on, door-mounted, replacement).
    *   Provide tips on how to set them up correctly for maximum visibility and safety.

*   **New Article: Power Management Tips:**
    *   Create a guide explaining 12V systems, solar power, battery maintenance, and tips for conserving power while off-grid.

*   **New Resource: Games & Activities for Camping:**
    *   Compile a list of suggestions for games (card games, outdoor games) and activities suitable for families, couples, and solo travelers while camping.

### Dynamic In-App Content with Firestore

The Recommended Approach for KamperHub: Dynamic In-App Content with Firestore!

Given your app is a Web app and you're already using Firebase Firestore for kamperhubv2 , the absolute best approach is to store your blog article content in Firestore and fetch it dynamically within your app.

**How it works:**

*   **Store Content in Firestore:** Create a new collection in your kamperhubv2 database, perhaps named `blogPosts`. Each document in this collection would represent a single blog article.
*   **Document Structure:**
    *   `id`: (Firestore Document ID) e.g., "pack-smart-tow-safe"
    *   `title`: "Pack Smart, Tow Safe: A Novice's Guide..."
    *   `introduction`: "The exhilarating moment of packing..."
    *   `sections`: An array of objects, where each object represents a section with a `heading` and `content`.
    *   `wordCount`: ~1000
    *   `publishDate`: (Timestamp)
    *   `imageUrl`: (Optional, link to a Cloud Storage image)
    *   `relatedTopics`: (Optional, array of strings for tagging/categorization)
    *   `author`: "KamperHub Team"
*   **Fetch Content in App:** When a user navigates to an article in your KamperHub app, your JavaScript/TypeScript code makes a call to Firestore to retrieve the relevant document from the `blogPosts` collection.
*   **Display in App:** Your app then dynamically renders the title, introduction, and sections. You can use Markdown rendering libraries if you store your content in Markdown format within Firestore.

**Why this is the best for KamperHub:**

*   **Seamless UX:** Users never leave your app.
*   **Consistent Design:** You control the styling completely.
*   **Dynamic Updates:** Change an article in Firestore, and it immediately updates in the app for all users without needing to redeploy your web app.
*   **Leverages Existing Firebase:** You're already set up with Firestore, so you're not introducing new backend services.
*   **Offline Support:** Firestore has built-in offline capabilities, meaning users can access previously viewed articles even without a connection (if implemented correctly on the client side).
*   **Personalization (Future):** You could personalize content delivery, track popular articles, or even allow users to bookmark articles within your app.

**In conclusion:**

For your KamperHub web app, definitely add the text to the app, but do it dynamically by storing the content in Firebase Firestore. This gives you the best of both worlds: a fantastic user experience and flexible, real-time content management. It truly makes your app feel like a comprehensive resource for caravanners!
