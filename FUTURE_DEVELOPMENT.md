# Future Development Ideas for KamperHub

This document tracks potential new features and enhancements for the KamperHub application.

## Core Functionality Enhancements

*   **Multi-Stop Trip Planning:**
    *   Allow users to add multiple intermediate waypoints to their trips in the Trip Planner.
    *   Display the full multi-stop route on the map.
    *   Calculate total distance, duration, and fuel estimates for the entire multi-leg journey.
    *   Update the Trip Log to clearly represent and recall multi-stop trips.

*   **Cloud Data Sync & Backup:**
    *   Migrate user-specific data (Vehicles, Caravans, WDHs, Inventory, Trip Logs, Checklists, Bookings, Dashboard Layout) from `localStorage` to a cloud-based backend (e.g., Firestore).
    *   This would enable data persistence across devices and browsers, and provide a backup.

*   **Advanced Weight Distribution Calculator:**
    *   Enhance the Inventory & Weight Management section with a more precise calculator for Tow Ball Mass (TBM).
    *   Allow users to specify the exact longitudinal position of items within defined storage locations (or even general areas like "front," "middle," "rear" of the caravan).
    *   Use these positions and weights to provide a more accurate TBM estimation than the current simple percentage of payload.

## User Experience & Engagement

*   **Enhanced Rewards & Gamification:**
    *   Implement the "Rewards Program" outlined in `/rewards`.
    *   Introduce badges or achievements for milestones (e.g., total distance traveled, number of trips completed, types of sites visited).
    *   Potentially add a points system that could unlock minor perks or cosmetic customizations.

*   **Community Features (Phase 1 - Sharing):**
    *   Allow users to (optionally) share saved trips (anonymized or with attribution) with other KamperHub users.
    *   Enable sharing of public campsite reviews or tips.

*   **Offline Checklists:**
    *   Investigate options for making checklists (especially for an active trip) available and modifiable offline, with syncing when connectivity is restored.

## AI & Automation

*   **AI-Powered Trip Suggestions:**
    *   Based on user preferences (e.g., type of travel, interests, past trips), suggest potential destinations or routes.
    *   Integrate with the Chatbot to help users plan trips conversationally.

*   **Automated Maintenance Reminders:**
    *   Allow users to log caravan/vehicle service dates and set reminders for common maintenance tasks (e.g., tyre checks, bearing services) based on time or distance traveled (if GPS tracking were ever implemented).

## Technical & Infrastructure

*   **Comprehensive End-to-End Testing:**
    *   Develop a suite of automated tests covering all major user flows and functionalities.

*   **CI/CD Pipeline Optimization:**
    *   Further refine the deployment pipeline for smoother and more reliable updates.
